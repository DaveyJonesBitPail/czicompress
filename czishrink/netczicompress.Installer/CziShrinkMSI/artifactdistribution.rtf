Microsoft Public License (MS-PL)\par
\par
This license governs use of the accompanying software. If you use the software,\par
you accept this license. If you do not accept the license, do not use the software.\par
\par
Definitions The terms "reproduce," "reproduction," "derivative works," and\par
"distribution" have the same meaning here as under U.S. copyright law. A\par
"contribution" is the original software, or any additions or changes to the\par
software. A "contributor" is any person that distributes its contribution under\par
this license. "Licensed patents" are a contributor's patent claims that read\par
directly on its contribution.\par
\par
Grant of Rights (A) Copyright Grant- Subject to the terms of this license,\par
including the license conditions and limitations in section 3, each contributor\par
grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce\par
its contribution, prepare derivative works of its contribution, and distribute its\par
contribution or any derivative works that you create. (B) Patent Grant- Subject\par
to the terms of this license, including the license conditions and limitations in\par
section 3, each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\par
license under its licensed patents to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale,\par
import, and/or otherwise dispose of its contribution in the software or derivative\par
works of the contribution in the software.\par
\par
Conditions and Limitations (A) No Trademark License- This license does not grant\par
you rights to use any contributors' name, logo, or trademarks. (B) If you bring a\par
patent claim against any contributor over patents that you claim are infringed by\par
the software, your patent license from such contributor to the software ends\par
automatically. (C) If you distribute any portion of the software, you must retain\par
all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices that are present in the\par
software. (D) If you distribute any portion of the software in source code form,\par
you may do so only under this license by including a complete copy of this license\par
with your distribution. If you distribute any portion of the software in compiled\par
or object code form, you may only do so under a license that complies with this\par
license. (E) The software is licensed "as-is." You bear the risk of using it.\par
The contributors give no express warranties, guarantees or conditions. You may\par
have additional consumer rights under your local laws which this license cannot\par
change. To the extent permitted under your local laws, the contributors exclude\par
the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose\par
and non-infringement.\par

\par
      as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\par
\par
      the version number 2.1.]\par
\par
\par
Preamble\par
--------\par
\par
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share\par
and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to\par
guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the\par
software is free for all its users.\par
\par
This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially\par
designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software\par
Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we\par
suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary\par
General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case,\par
based on the explanations below.\par
\par
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price.\par
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom\par
to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish);\par
that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change\par
the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed\par
that you can do these things.\par
\par
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to\par
deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions\par
translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the\par
library or if you modify it.\par
\par
For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a\par
fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make\par
sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code\par
with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so\par
that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library\par
and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\par
\par
We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and\par
(2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy,\par
distribute and/or modify the library.\par
\par
To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no\par
warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else\par
and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original\par
version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by\par
problems that might be introduced by others.\par
\par
Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free\par
program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the\par
users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder.\par
Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the\par
library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this\par
license.\par
\par
Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU\par
General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License,\par
applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary\par
General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to\par
permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.\par
\par
When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared\par
library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a\par
derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore\par
permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.\par
The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other\par
code with the library.\par
\par
We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less to\par
protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also\par
provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing\par
non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General\par
Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides\par
advantages in certain special circumstances.\par
\par
For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the\par
widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard.\par
To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more\par
frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free\par
libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to\par
free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\par
\par
In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs\par
enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For\par
example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many\par
more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the\par
GNU/Linux operating system.\par
\par
Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users'\par
freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the\par
Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified\par
version of the Library.\par
\par
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\par
follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the\par
library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived\par
from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order\par
to run.\par
\par
\par
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\par
---------------------------------------------------------------\par
\par
0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which\par
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying\par
it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also\par
called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".\par
\par
A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as\par
to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those\par
functions and data) to form executables.\par
\par
The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been\par
distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means either the\par
Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work\par
containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications\par
and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter,\par
translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)\par
\par
"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\par
modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source\par
code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files,\par
plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.\par
\par
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by\par
this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the\par
Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its\par
contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the\par
Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the\par
Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.\par
\par
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source\par
code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\par
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer\par
of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the\par
absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\par
Library.\par
\par
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at\par
your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\par
\par
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus\par
forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications\par
or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of\par
these conditions:\par
\par
      a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\par
\par
      b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating\par
      that you changed the files and the date of any change.\par
\par
      c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all\par
      third parties under the terms of this License.\par
\par
      d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of\par
      data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other\par
      than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make\par
      a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not\par
      supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs\par
      whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.\par
\par
      (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose\par
      that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore,\par
      Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used\par
      by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it,\par
      the square root function must still compute square roots.)\par
\par
      These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable\par
      sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be\par
      reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then\par
      this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you\par
      distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same\par
      sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the\par
      distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose\par
      permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to\par
      each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\par
\par
      Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your\par
      rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise\par
      the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works\par
      based on the Library.\par
\par
      In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with\par
      the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage\par
      or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of\par
      this License.\par
\par
3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License\par
instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must\par
alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the\par
ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a\par
newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has\par
appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any\par
other change in these notices.\par
\par
Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so\par
the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and\par
derivative works made from that copy.\par
\par
This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into\par
a program that is not a library.\par
\par
4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it,\par
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1\par
and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding\par
machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of\par
Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.\par
\par
If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a\par
designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from\par
the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even\par
though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object\par
code.\par
\par
5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is\par
designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called\par
a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative\par
work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\par
\par
However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an\par
executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of\par
the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable is\par
therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of\par
such executables.\par
\par
When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is part\par
of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the\par
Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially\par
significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is\par
itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by\par
law.\par
\par
If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and\par
accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in\par
length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether\par
it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus\par
portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)\par
\par
Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the\par
object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing\par
that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with\par
the Library itself.\par
\par
6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work\par
that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of\par
the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that\par
the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\par
engineering for debugging such modifications.\par
\par
You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is\par
used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must\par
supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright\par
notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as\par
well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you\par
must do one of these things:\par
\par
      a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable\par
      source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the\par
      work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the\par
      work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete\par
      machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source\par
      code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a\par
      modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that\par
      the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will\par
      not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified\par
      definitions.)\par
\par
      b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A\par
      suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library\par
      already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library\par
      functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a\par
      modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the\par
      modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was\par
      made with.\par
\par
      c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years,\par
      to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for\par
      a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.\par
\par
      d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a\par
      designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified\par
      materials from the same place.\par
\par
      e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or\par
      that you have already sent this user a copy.\par
\par
For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must\par
include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from\par
it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not\par
include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form)\par
with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system\par
on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the\par
executable.\par
\par
It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other\par
proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a\par
contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an\par
executable that you distribute.\par
\par
7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library\par
side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not\par
covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that\par
the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other\par
library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two\par
things:\par
\par
      a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the\par
      Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be\par
      distributed under the terms of the Sections above.\par
\par
      b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of\par
      it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\par
      accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\par
\par
8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library\par
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,\par
modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will\par
automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have\par
received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their\par
licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\par
\par
9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.\par
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library\par
or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept\par
this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work\par
based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\par
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library\par
or works based on it.\par
\par
10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library),\par
the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to\par
copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and\par
conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'\par
exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing\par
compliance by third parties with this License.\par
\par
11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement\par
or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on\par
you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the\par
conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this\par
License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your\par
obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a\par
consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent\par
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those\par
who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you\par
could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from\par
distribution of the Library.\par
\par
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\par
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the\par
section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\par
\par
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or\par
other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this\par
section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software\par
distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people\par
have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\par
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is\par
up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software\par
through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\par
\par
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a\par
consequence of the rest of this License.\par
\par
12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain\par
countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright\par
holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical\par
distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is\par
permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this\par
License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\par
\par
13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the\par
Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be\par
similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new\par
problems or concerns.\par
\par
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a\par
version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you\par
have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or\par
of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library\par
does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever\par
published by the Free Software Foundation.\par
\par
14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs\par
whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to\par
ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software\par
Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions\par
for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free\par
status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and\par
reuse of software generally.\par
\par
NO WARRANTY\par
\par
15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE\par
LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED\par
IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS"\par
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT\par
LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A\par
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\par
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\par
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\par
\par
16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL\par
ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE\par
LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,\par
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY\par
TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\par
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF\par
THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER\par
PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\par
\par
\par
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\par
\par
\par
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\par
----------------------------------------------\par
\par
If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use\par
to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can\par
redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these\par
terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public\par
License).\par
\par
To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest\par
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the\par
exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line\par
and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\par
\par
      one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.\par
\par
      Copyright (C) year name of author\par
\par
      This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\par
\par
      modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\par
\par
      License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\par
\par
      version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\par
\par
      This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\par
\par
      but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\par
\par
      MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU\par
\par
      Lesser General Public License for more details.\par
\par
      You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public\par
\par
      License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\par
\par
      Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA\par
\par
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\par
\par
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,\par
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if necessary. Here is a\par
sample; alter the names:\par
\par
      Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in\par
\par
      the library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written\par
\par
      by James Random Hacker.\par
\par
      signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1990\par

2. License Grants and Conditions\par
--------------------------------\par
\par
\par
  2.1. Grants\par
\par
  Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive\par
  license:\par
\par
    a. \par
\par
      under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)\par
      Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available, modify,\par
      display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its Contributions,\par
      either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as part of a Larger\par
      Work; and\par
\par
    b. \par
\par
      under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for sale,\par
      have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions or its\par
      Contributor Version.\par
\par
\par
  2.2. Effective Date\par
\par
  The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become\par
  effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes\par
  such Contribution.\par
\par
\par
  2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope\par
\par
  The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this\par
  License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution\par
  or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding\par
  Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:\par
\par
    a. \par
\par
      for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or\par
\par
    b. \par
\par
      for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's\par
      modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its\par
      Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor\par
      Version); or\par
\par
    c. \par
\par
      under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its\par
      Contributions.\par
\par
  This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or\par
  logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice\par
  requirements in Section 3.4).\par
\par
\par
  2.4. Subsequent Licenses\par
\par
  No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute\par
  the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see\par
  Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the\par
  terms of Section 3.3).\par
\par
\par
  2.5. Representation\par
\par
  Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are\par
  its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its\par
  Contributions conveyed by this License.\par
\par
\par
  2.6. Fair Use\par
\par
  This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable\par
  copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.\par
\par
\par
  2.7. Conditions\par
\par
  Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in\par
  Section 2.1.\par
\par
\par
3. Responsibilities\par
-------------------\par
\par
\par
  3.1. Distribution of Source Form\par
\par
  All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\par
  Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the\par
  terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of\par
  the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can\par
  obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the\par
  recipients' rights in the Source Code Form.\par
\par
\par
  3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\par
\par
  If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\par
\par
    a. \par
\par
      such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as\par
      described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable\par
      Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable\par
      means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution\par
      to the recipient; and\par
\par
    b. \par
\par
      You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or\par
      sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the\par
      Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights\par
      in the Source Code Form under this License.\par
\par
\par
  3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\par
\par
  You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\par
  provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the\par
  Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with\par
  a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is\par
  not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to\par
  additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary\par
  License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option,\par
  further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License\par
  or such Secondary License(s).\par
\par
\par
  3.4. Notices\par
\par
  You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including\par
  copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of\par
  liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software,\par
  except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy\par
  known factual inaccuracies.\par
\par
\par
  3.5. Application of Additional Terms\par
\par
  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity\par
  or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.\par
  However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any\par
  Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support,\par
  indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby\par
  agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such\par
  Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You\par
  offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of\par
  liability specific to any jurisdiction.\par
\par
\par
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\par
---------------------------------------------------\par
\par
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with\par
respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or\par
regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the\par
maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they\par
affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all\par
distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent\par
prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently\par
detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\par
\par
\par
5. Termination\par
--------------\par
\par
  5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You\par
  fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then\par
  the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are\par
  reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and\par
  finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such\par
  Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means\par
  prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your\par
  grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such\par
  Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this\par
  is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License\par
  from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your\par
  receipt of the notice.\par
\par
  5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\par
  infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and\par
  cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly\par
  infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all\par
  Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall\par
  terminate.\par
\par
  5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user\par
  license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been\par
  validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to\par
  termination shall survive termination.\par
\par
\par
6. Disclaimer of Warranty\par
-------------------------\par
\par
Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" basis, without\par
warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without\par
limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,\par
merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as\par
to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any\par
Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume\par
the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of\par
warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered\par
Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.\par
\par
\par
7. Limitation of Liability\par
--------------------------\par
\par
Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including\par
negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who\par
distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct,\par
indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character\par
including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work\par
stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial\par
damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility\par
of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for\par
death or personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the extent\par
applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the\par
exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion\par
and limitation may not apply to You.\par
\par
\par
8. Litigation\par
-------------\par
\par
Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a\par
jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and\par
such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference\par
to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a\par
party's ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.\par
\par
\par
9. Miscellaneous\par
----------------\par
\par
This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter\par
hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such\par
provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.\par
Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be\par
construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against\par
a Contributor.\par
\par
\par
10. Versions of the License\par
---------------------------\par
\par
\par
  10.1. New Versions\par
\par
  Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3,\par
  no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new\par
  versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version\par
  number.\par
\par
\par
  10.2. Effect of New Versions\par
\par
  You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the\par
  License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the\par
  terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.\par
\par
\par
  10.3. Modified Versions\par
\par
  If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a\par
  new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of\par
  this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of\par
  the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from\par
  this License).\par
\par
\par
  10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary\par
  Licenses\par
\par
  If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With\par
  Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the notice\par
  described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.\par
